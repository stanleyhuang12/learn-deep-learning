# learn-deep-learning
Learning the mathematics and doing some deep learning projects

Started: May 2024

Since then, I have studied a vanilla neural network, dense neural network, backpropagation, cost functions for regression and categorization problems, vanilla recurrent neural network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). 

My goal is to make it to Transformers.
